changelog=0.4.6: Fix: Integrity checks fully support expressions
    0.4.5.1: Missed label for new UI Element
    0.4.5: Replace hard coded min threshold for spatial integrity checks with UI value (double spin box)
    0.4.4: Fix hide layer after edit / log timesplit to documentation (ids of original items)
    0.4.3: Fix: reset UI and kill worker and thread as integrity check dropdown changes
    0.4.2: Fix: Clear the UI every time integrity check starts
    0.4.1: Fix: check if layer is not in edit mode before integrity check dialog (standard error dialog)
    0.4.0: Allow expressions in integrity check to allow limiting the affected features; Fixed spatial intersection bug
    0.3.8: Added sidecar output for CSV (allowing drag and drop)
    0.3.7: Fixed updating geometry if valid_end date matches split date
    0.3.7-rc: Working temporary layer edit, remaining bug for existing date set
    0.3.6: Burst Geometry Collections into Multipolygons (ignoring linestrings)
    0.3.5: Export Geometry Intersections to CSV as WKT
    0.3.4: Abort Time integrity on invalid dates 
    0.3.3: Display message at end of all operations (if nothing found)

    0.3.0: Better error reporting in Table Widget (including export to csv)
    0.2.9: Bug fix core dump after aborting the worker
    0.2.8: Performance boost from iterating only within bounding box
    0.2.7: Integrity Checks for overlapping Features (needs performance boost from GeometryEngine)
    0.2.6: Integrity Checks for geometric validity (using .isGeosValid())
    0.2.5: Integrity Check for individual dates (no empty strings, no invalid dates)
    0.2.4: Progressbar works again
    0.2.3: If features are selected, run integrity check only on those
    0.2.2: Take NULL values in to account in layer filter 
        Fix Division by zero for small feature sets
        Time Split works again
    0.2.1: Handle no selected vector layer and give an error hint
